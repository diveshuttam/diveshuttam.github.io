Hey world,  
So finally this portfolio is no more under construction (ribbon cut and claps).
I think I have arrived at what I wanted for this: Its light, speedy and
fulfilling.

This blog will contain all about me, my projects and things I am working on
currently.
The main motive is to to explore myself as a person and sharing what all I do
and have done in the past. This portfolio fulfils desires of techies, stalkers
or someone who just wants to know more about me (I hope there is someone :p).

I was reluctant to start this as it is quite some work and I was afraid that
it will remain unmaintained. But now I have put up my mind maintain it atleast
fortnightly.

So folks that's all for now I will explore what all tech went behind this
blog in the coming posts.
