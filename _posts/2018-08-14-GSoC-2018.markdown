# EasyGnuPG

**Student:** Divesh Uttamchandani  
**Mentors:** Dashamir Hoxha, T. K. Sourab

## About EGPG

**[EasyGnuPG][egpg] (a.k.a EGPG)** is a shell script that wraps [GPG]
and tries to make it more accessible and more easy to use.
In order to simplify things, it is opinionated about the _"right"_ way of using [GnuPG][GPG].

`EGPG` has a basic set of commands which wrap most commonly used commands in GnuPG.
It makes gpg's use consistant, easier and follows good practices for encryption.

Refer Dashamir's [blog post on EGPG][egpg-blog] for the detailed philosophy behind EGPG.

## About my GSoC project

`EGPG` is wrapped around `gpg` and calls it internally. This makes it sensitive to the changes
in `gpg` commandline interface and hence unstable.

My inital [GSoC proposal][gsoc-proposal] was to replicate `EGPG` functionality in python
built with [GPGME] python bindings. Though at a later point we realized that instead of porting
the complete command line from bash to python, we can simplify our project by only replacing
the calls to `gpg` CLI in `EGPG` with calls to python scripts.
This would make the testing easier as well as we can rely on the stablility of existing `egpg` system.

Though I had done some work towards the [complete python rewrite][pgpg-click]  during the second week,
but we shifted to the other appraoch after this.

Apart from this, since the project got a bit easier, I worked on creating
the debian package as well as a Basic GUI for `egpg` using [YAD] . Though quite some work has
been done but they are not ready for general use yet. I plan to contribute
towards the project after GSoC and plan to finish these off.

## Final work product

The final work product can be found in the [EasyGnuPG/pgpg#gnupg][pgpg] repo.
You can also find the diff of major work done by me in [EasyGnuPG/pgpg#PR/88][final-pr].

Most of my commits can be found here:
- [EasyGnuPG/pgpg#gnupg-2.2]
- [EasyGnuPG/egpg#gnupg-2.2-gui]

## What could not be completed

- Though many of the calls in `egpg` were ported. Some couldn't be done due to technical difficulties
  faced with GPGME bindings.
  These can be found as issues with label [gsoc/not-fixed] in EasyGnuPG/pgpg.

- Though we did prepare a basic Debian package, it has not been published and is not complaint with
  Debian policy yet.
  
- The GUI could not be completed as my university began on 1st August 2018 which decreased my work capacity.
  Though I plan to contribute further and finish this after GSoC.


## Difficulties faced
- One of the major difficulty in this was working with the GPGME.
  It is good and most of the operations required for the project could be completed.
  They do provide a finer control over the engine as well as output format,
  But they don't support all the operations. There are many things that we can't achieve through
  GPGME. Even if there is a way it is quite combursome. Like using `interact` funcitonality which 
  is essentially like `gpg --edit-key` follwed by exchanging lower level commands with the engine.
  
 - Also for the python bindings, they are developed over SWIG and are still being updated with a 
   higher level API for python. For my project I have used higher level API whenever possible.

## Major takeaways

GSoC was a great learning experience. Major take away includes:
- Bash Scripting
- Working of GnuPG and its various components
- Python
- Yad
