# TLDR : 

Trying out [Digital Mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_and_technology) for sometime. 
I am still posting/creating content but very selectively consuming. 
If you want to reach out; best ways are 
 - email 
 - phone
 - meet
 - catch me up in cubban park in the morning:)

# Context : 

Digital Technology has empowered me to create and increase happiness level in my life to a great extent. 
Though with increased usage my relationship with tech and in particular social media hasn't remained that great and I have ended up with increased sense of insecurity and negetivity about the world to a point my model of universe got detached from evidences. Have been trying out various versions of this since an year, have seen them help quite a lot, but only in phases. Since had the luxury of a career break for some time. Taking the ownership and trying to create "ME" system around it so these issues are done with for good.
As a man of tech I recently realized I can easily create the boundaries that I want with the help of tech itself.


# What to expect ? 
Mostly, extended periods of irresponsiveness on linkedin, instagram, facebook etc.

# What am I filtering out ?
All notifications (likes, comments, messages), posts, stories. Though have created ways to post without involving apps (more to come in another blog post).

# What are the exact set of issues I faced? 
Mostly have got acceptance around the fact that we humans are just an "version of self" on these platforms and there is a lot more love to go around to people behind these handles, want to keep it that way. 

# Why Not Deactivate / Delete : 
I still find Instagram and LinkedIn as very useful tools to create and document my own journey's and stories. 
These platforms empower each individual to etch their own histories in the way they want (for free).
